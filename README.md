# Personal SPA Page (Work in Progress)
A simple project containing a Python 3 server and a plain CSS and JavaScript responsive SPA, made to understand Full Stack development.

## Getting Started !
### Prerequisites
The only two things needed to run this project is an copy of the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Interpreter and a Web Browser of choice.
### Initialising
To start the server just open the **initserver.bat** file (*Trust me, it's not a virus*), and to stop the server just type **_Exit_** in the prompt that appears in the console and hit **_Enter_**. Like so:
```
_>Exit *Hit Enter*
```
For now that's the only command coded in the server console, feel free to add more if you want.
### Using The Library
If you're intrested in using the python HTTP Server library I wrote, just add the **Modules** folder to your project and do the proper importing ther's also a small documentation detaling it's behavior.

### Running Tests
With you wanna used small HTTP library I wrote to create this project, to build your own server and wanna test the routes you created, a program I recommend for doing so is [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

## Built With
